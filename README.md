#LangGraph Agent Project

A simple LangGraph-based AI Agent project built for learning and experimenting with LangChain + LangGraph workflows.
This repo demonstrates how to build a graph-based agent pipeline that can run iterative tasks like generating content, refining responses, and managing state.

🚀 Features

✅ Uses LangGraph for workflow orchestration

✅ Uses LangChain chat models (Gemini / OpenAI supported)

✅ Demonstrates stateful agent execution

✅ Supports iterative loops (max iterations control)

✅ Beginner-friendly structure for learning LangGraph
